Title: A Comparative Study of Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Lexicon-based and Machine Learning Techniques on Environmental, Political and Economical Issues

Abstract: 	Social networking services became an integral part of our society's existence. The amount of data that's being generated everyday contains every bit of our lives. In this context, sentiment analysis plays a key role in various different industries in order to grasp people's opinions and emotions on a person or an entity through text or through visual data. This report conducted a comparative study of sentiment analysis using lexicon-based and machine learning algorithms on twitter datasets of various current issues. We developed a detailed methodology in order to train models or predict sentiments. On one hand, we tested various algorithms for machine learning but decided on Naive Bayes based algorithms: ComplementNB, BernoulliNB and MultimonialNB along with logistic regression. On the other hand, we used VADER rule-based sentiment analysis tool for lexicon-based approach. This report discusses in detail all the above mentioned topics and provides a methodology with excellent accuracy for twitter text classification.
